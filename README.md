# Eternal Grace Arena
Eternal Grace Arena is a third person Action game and was developed for my final diplomas degree at SAE University.  
Considering the limited development time of about 3.5 months, I designed it at a prototype for Project "Eternal Grace".    
Focusing on making myself familiar with Unreal Engine 5, its reflection system, its animation system and for example its level design tools.  

##Gameplay Loop
Eternal Grace Arena uses Soulslike Combat and controls, while limiting the players actions by a stamina bar.
From a Hub Area the player teleports to various levels and faces an Enemy encounter he has to defeat.  
After defeating each Encounter the player can end the game by talking to Loretta, the npc in the Hub Area.
